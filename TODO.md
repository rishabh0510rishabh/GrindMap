# TODO: Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with Testing and Code Quality Section

## Tasks
- [x] Add "Testing and Code Quality" section to CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed guidelines on running tests, writing tests using Jest, linting with ESLint, backend-specific testing (e.g., mocking scrapers), and code review requirements (e.g., test coverage reports and security audits via backend/security-audit.sh).
